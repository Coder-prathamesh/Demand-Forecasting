# Demand-Forecasting
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis(EDA) and data modelling performed on the Online Retail dataset. The dataset is taken from open source repository and can be downloaded from the following link (Link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail ).
The aim of this project was to predict the future demand based on past historical available data.
So to achieve this objective various statistical models such as Auto-regression, ARIMA and Holt's Winter Exponential Smoothing were build.
Also neural network models such as FB Prophet and LSTM were build.
Finally, the performance of each model was examined to determine which model is more suitable for the given problem statement.
